%  MBX .tex output can be produced via xsltproc without specifying the stringparam "latex.style.extra", 
%  and default styling will be used. If you wish to use a style file like this one for further styling,
%  run xsltproc with --stringparam "latex.style.extra" "<path to this file or one like it>"
%
%  Tags in this file start with <*tagname>, and end with </tagname>, and should have some commentary on
%  what each one does. The contents of tags should be TeX commands, not just strings. For instance, if
%  the styling involves loading a package with options, you would use the entire \usepackage[]{}, not 
%  just spell out the package options. 
%
%  In MBX .tex output, the new command \mbxstylefile should point to this style file, or a similar file.
%  If it is an empty string, default styling will be used.
%
%  In MBX .tex output, the new command \mbxstyle appears multiple times in the preamble as \mbxstyle{#1}{#2}.
%  #2 is simply commands that will be used if a style.tex file like this one is not being used. #1 is a tagname
%  that appears in the style.tex file.
%
%  Once xcltproc is used to produce a .tex file using a style.tex file like this one, then a lot of 
%  customiztion of appearance can be done without further use of xsltproc. For instance, the style.tex file 
%  can be edited, and then the .tex file can go through pdflatex again, and changes will be reflected.
%
%  Or the author can manually edit the .tex MBX output and change the path to the style.tex file, to 
%  get a new styling. An author could have an array of style.tex files that they switch back and forth on.
%
%  Or the author can revert to default styling be redefining how \mbxstyle is defined. For convenience, a
%  \renewcommand line is provided that can be uncommented to achieve this.  Note that this doesn't work in 
%  the opposite direction. If xsltproc is run the first time without a style.tex file, then several important 
%  things are left out of the preamble that allow for use of a style.tex file in the first place.

%% theoremstyle for theorems
%% Either use \theoremstyle{<existing style>} or define a new style and then use it.

%% in the MBX .tex output's preamble. While this style sheet should maintain an order
%% that is consistent with that order, it is not a guarantee.
%% \surroundwithmdframed may be used to decorate the environment. See its documentation.
